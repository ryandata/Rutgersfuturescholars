This is a small repository of materials relating to Data Science for [Rutgers Future Scholars](https://futurescholars.rutgers.edu/).

For the summers of 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019, Ryan Womack taught Rutgers Future Scholars interns (rising juniors) a mini-course on data science topics over four half-days, while Francesca Giannetti taught Digital Humanities topics and Jill Nathanson coordinated the program.  COVID interrupted this in-person experience.  

In summer 2023, the Libraries returned to offering an internship experience for RFS with a team-taught approach including librarians Tajah Ebram, Francesca Giannetti, Julia Maxwell, and Ryan Womack.

In summer 2024, the Libraries returned to offering an internship experience for RFS with a team-taught approach including librarians Tajah Ebram, Mei Ling Lo, Sue Oldenburg, and Ryan Womack.

In summer 2025, the Libraries returned to offering an internship experience for RFS with a team-taught approach including librarians Tajah Ebram, Francesca Giannetti, Mei Ling Lo, and Ryan Womack.

This repository contains materials for the current (2025) single half-day version of an **introduction to data science** in a library context.

The [RFS_data_science_resources.md](https://github.com/ryandata/Rutgersfuturescholars/blob/master/RFS_data_science_resources.md) file is the place to get started.
