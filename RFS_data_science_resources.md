This is a small repository of materials relating to Data Science for [Rutgers Future Scholars](https://futurescholars.rutgers.edu/).

For the summers of 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019, Ryan Womack taught Rutgers Future Scholars interns (rising juniors) a mini-course on data science topics over four half-days, while Francesca Giannetti taught Digital Humanities topics and Jill Nathanson coordinated the program.  COVID interrupted this in-person experience.  In summer 2023, the Libraries returned to offering an internship experience for RFS with a team-taught approach including librarians Tajah Ebram, Francesca Giannetti, and Julia Maxwell.

This repository contains materials for the current single half-day version of an introduction to data science in a library context.

Rutgers Future Scholars met for one week during the summer of 2019.  Current trends in big data and analytics were discussed.  Interns were introduced to importing, analyzing, and graphing data in the R statistical software environment, using real and current data sources from the Education Department and the US Census, working with data dictionaries and APIs, and understanding data via interactive visualization tools.
